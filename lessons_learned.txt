#1 - flake8 W391

The pep8 and flake8 linting message 'W391 blank line at end of file' means to add a blank line at the end of
the file.  For the longest time, I thought that error message was asking me to remove the 'eof' or 'crlf' character
from the end of a file.  Or.. to use the dos2unix tool on the files throwing that error message.

From the Flake8 docs, W391 rule is stated as..

There should be one, and only one, blank line at the end of each file. This warning will occur when there are zero, two,
or more than two blank lines.
